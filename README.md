# Capturing Humanity: Selfies in Context

## Project Desicription
Capturing Humanity is an interactive installation that showcases the history of humanity through self-portraits, also known as 'selfies'. The project invites passersby to take self-portraits and contribute to a gallery and timeline of self-portraits throughout history. This creates a sense of connection and identity among people, while demonstration how human behavior has evolved alongside technology.

The installation also aims to evoke a vintage, nostalgic feeling that is tied to the history of image capture. This is achieved through the website UI and a thermal printer that provides participants with a keepsake portrait, similar to a photo booth.

Overall, the project places the tradition of self-portraits within a larger context of human history and identity.
